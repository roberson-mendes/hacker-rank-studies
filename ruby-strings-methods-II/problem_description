In this challenge, your task is to write the following methods:

mask_article which appends strike tags around certain words in a text. The method takes 2 arguments: A string and an array of words. It then replaces all the instances of words in the text with the modified version.
A helper method strike, given one string, appends strike off HTML tags around it. The strike off HTML tag is <strike></strike>.
For example:

> strike("Meow!") # => "<strike>Meow!</strike>"
> strike("Foolan Barik") # => "<strike>Foolan Barik</strike>"
> mask_article("Hello World! This is crap!", ["crap"])
"Hello World! This is <strike>crap</strike>!"
