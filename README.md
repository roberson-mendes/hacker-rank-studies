# hacker-rank-studies
The intend of this repository is to save my hacker-rank solutions.
The first version (brutal-force) solution and it's refactorings are one after another.

# considerations
- Each folder has one problem with the respective solution and problem description
- Each exercicise may have more than one resolution version in the same file, separated only by comment headers.
  - These comments are like "refactor x" to present a refactore i've made on the solution
- Not always it will have the best practices right in the first version of each resolution, but the intention is
refactoring it along the way and consequently the best practices will be appearing.
- Some archives has some fancy tests (without many good practices). To run this tests, just run ruby "archive-name.rb"
with Ruby installed on your pc.
