Just my hacker-rank resolutions

# considerations
- Each exercicise may have more than one resolution version in the same file, separated only by comment headers.
- Maybe the exercise can have statement with it, maybe not.
- Not always it will have the best practices right in the first version of each resolution, but the intention is refactoring it along the way and consequently the best practices will be appearing.
