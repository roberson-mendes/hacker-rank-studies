# hacker-rank-studies
The intend of this repository is to save my hacker-rank solutions.
The first version (brutal-force) solution and it's refactorings are one after another.

# considerations
- The best practices isn't followed in this repository, once it's focus is to solve the problems.
- Each folder has one problem with the respectives solution and problem
- Some archives has some fancy tests (without any framework). To run this tests, just run ruby "archive-name.rb"
with Ruby installed on your pc.
