# hacker-rank-studies
The intend of this repository is to save my hacker-rank solutions.
The first version (brutal-force) solution and it's refactorings are one after another.

# considerations
- The best practices isn't followed in this repository, once its focus is to practice problem solving in a simple manner.
- Each folder has one problem name from hacker-rank with the respectives solutions and problem description.
- Some archives has some fancy tests (without any framework). To run this tests, just run ruby "archive-name.rb" with Ruby installed on your pc.
